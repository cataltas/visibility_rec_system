# Visibility Popularity Predictor (Summer 2020) 
This project is a self-directed project, by Camille Taltas, which has for goal of increasing the visibility of women in the music industry. The approach taken here is to think of a recommender system which can both build a ranking of songs most-likely to be liked by the user while trying to keep the proportion of male to female artists at 50/50. Given that user data is not publicly available, the metric for likeability in this project is an overall popularity ranking, provided by Spotify for each song. The absence of users contradicts the principle of a recommender system but this predictive model has been build with an application to recommender systems in mind. The theory used to merge both a ranking based prediction and a proportion restriction follows research for college admissions to merge a ranking of students and optimizing for diversity goals. This project is still being worked on. As of now, the data has been scraped, cleaned, and explored and the modeling part is currently being worked on. The scripts, gender.py, popularity.py, prepare_data.py, and songinfo.py, are all part of the scraping, reading in, merging, and cleaning of the data. The data was provided by Spotify and Music Brainz. Given that there are 6+ million songs in the final dataframe, all of this code is written and run using technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and, SQL.
